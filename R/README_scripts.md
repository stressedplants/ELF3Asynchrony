# ELF3Asynchrony

Let us summarise the scripts in this document:

01_simulation.r: How does the source of heterogeneity (starting point or maturation rate heterogeneity) influence trait heterogeneity at different life stages?
02_ArabidopsisHypocotyl.r:  How does ELF3 influence heterogeneity in hypocotyl length in Arabidopsis?
03_ArabidopsisFlower.r: How does ELF3 influence heterogeneity in bolting times in Arabidopsis?
04_BarleyHypocotyl.r:  How does HvELF3 influence heterogeneity in hypocotyl length in Barley?
05_BarleyFlower.r: How does HvELF3 influence heterogeneity in bolting times in Barley?
06_bethedging.r: How does this heterogeneity in biomass influence ability to withstand osmotic stress?
